# MLB Stats Guessing App

Currently unfinished project. Created with a Flask backend and Vite frontend. You are more than welcome to spin it up locally.

# Plans:
- Allow user to keep track of score.
- End game when user guesses wrong
- Add styling details related to each player
- Allow users to initialize the game with unique parameter: eg. year of stats, hitters/pitchers
