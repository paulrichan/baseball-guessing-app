# MLB Stats Guessing App

Currently unfinished project. Created with a Flask backend and Vite frontend. You are more than welcome to spin it up locally.

### Created with [python-mlb-statsapi](https://github.com/zero-sum-seattle/python-mlb-statsapi)

# Plans:
- [x] Allow user to keep track of score.
- [x] End game when user guesses wrong
- Add styling details related to each player
- Allow users to initialize the game with unique parameter: eg. year of stats, hitters/pitchers
- Host project
